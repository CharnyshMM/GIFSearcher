GIF Searcher

Using the Giphy API, create an app to be able to search for GIFs.
Requirements

GIFs must animate.

The main view should:
Show a list of Trending GIFs.
Show a search bar so a user can find a GIF.

After the user searches for a term, app will display results of search right there in the main view.

You can use HTTP libraries like Retrofit/OKHttp, but not API clients like GiphyAndroidApi.
Caution: Giphy API may send down height and width properties as a String instead of a float.
You may use 3rd party dependencies through Gradle in helping you build your app. If you use Gradle, please don't commit 3rd party source code.

Your solution should include a README explaining how to set up and run the project.
Bonus points for a nice and interesting UI.
Please use MVVM, and functional programming techniques where possible. Some libraries we enjoy are RxJava or Coroutines.
The following languages are acceptable: Java and Kotlin.
